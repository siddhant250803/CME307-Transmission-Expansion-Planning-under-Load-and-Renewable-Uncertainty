\title{Transmission Expansion Planning under Load and Renewable Uncertainty}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    We study transmission expansion planning (TEP) on the IEEE RTS-GMLC system~\cite{national_renewable_energy_laboratory_reliability_nodate} using a family of Pyomo models: a deterministic DC optimal power flow (DC-OPF), a single-period mixed-integer TEP, a time-series informed multi-period formulation, and a scenario-based robust variant. The through-line question is whether observed congestion or modeled uncertainty ever justifies building new transmission capacity. We first confirm that the static grid redispatches around its three congested corridors without expanding, then demonstrate that cheaper capital costs and time-series stress still maintain the ``do nothing'' decision. We price deliberate shortages via load shedding, and finally impose multiple simultaneous stress scenarios. Only the robust formulation triggers expansion, adding two 200~MW ties at \$61.3M to maintain feasibility across all scenarios.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
This project evaluates how transmission expansion decisions change when we move beyond a static DC-OPF benchmark to multi-period and robust formulations on the IEEE RTS-GMLC system. We draw on classic TEP literature for deterministic formulations~\cite{garver1970,conejo2006} and recent work on robustness under uncertainty~\cite{ruiz2015}. The central question is whether the congestion we see in the RTS-GMLC snapshot, or the uncertainty we model around it, is sufficient to justify building new lines.

Our approach is staged so the goal stays visible as we increase model complexity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Baseline DC-OPF and single-period TEP}: Establish that the existing network satisfies load; if congestion alone were binding, the MILP would build new lines, but it does not.
    \item \textbf{Cost and time-series stress}: Cheaper capital costs and stressed representative hours test whether economics or timing flip the decision.
    \item \textbf{Scarcity pricing}: A load-shedding variant converts shortages into explicit dollar costs, providing a benchmark for investment decisions.
    \item \textbf{Robust TEP}: A single build plan must satisfy multiple stress scenarios simultaneously; this final hurdle forces expansion.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data and Modeling Approach}
We rely on the RTS-GMLC static network comprising 73 buses across 3 interconnected regions, 120 AC transmission branches, 1 HVDC tie, and 158 generators with diverse fuel types including nuclear, coal, gas, hydro, wind, and solar. The dataset provides hourly time series for regional load, wind, photovoltaic (PV), and hydro production spanning a full year.

The \texttt{src/core/data\_loader.py} module handles loading and preprocessing of all static network data from CSV files, while \texttt{src/core/timeseries\_loader.py} aligns the time series data with the static topology. All operational models use Pyomo for algebraic modeling and Gurobi as the primary solver (with GLPK as a fallback). Candidate transmission corridors are generated automatically by \texttt{src/core/tep.py} based on network topology and geographic proximity, and cost functions can be switched between capacity-distance, pure distance, or capacity-only formulations to study capital expenditure assumptions.

\section{Mathematical Formulation}
Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of buses, $\mathcal{G}$ the set of generators, $\mathcal{L}$ the existing AC lines, and $\mathcal{C}$ the candidate corridors. The binary variable $x_\ell$ indicates whether candidate $\ell \in \mathcal{C}$ is built, $p_g$ is the generation of unit $g$, $\theta_b$ is the phase angle at bus $b$, and $f_\ell$ the power flow on line or candidate $\ell$. The single-period TEP model solves:
\begin{align}
    \min \quad & \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} c_g p_g + \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{C}} F_\ell x_\ell \label{eq:obj}                                                                                                                  \\
    \text{s.t.} \quad
               & \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}_b} p_g
    + \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_b^{\text{in}}} f_\ell
    - \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{L}_b^{\text{out}}} f_\ell
    + \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{C}_b^{\text{in}}} f_\ell
    - \sum_{\ell \in \mathcal{C}_b^{\text{out}}} f_\ell
    = d_b      &                                                                                             & \forall b \in \mathcal{B} \label{eq:balance}                                                                   \\
               & f_\ell = B_\ell (\theta_{i(\ell)} - \theta_{j(\ell)})                                       &                                              & \forall \ell \in \mathcal{L} \cup \mathcal{C} \label{eq:dcflow} \\
               & -\bar f_\ell \le f_\ell \le \bar f_\ell                                                     &                                              & \forall \ell \in \mathcal{L} \label{eq:existinglimit}           \\
               & -\bar f_\ell x_\ell \le f_\ell \le \bar f_\ell x_\ell                                       &                                              & \forall \ell \in \mathcal{C} \label{eq:candlimit}               \\
               & \underline{p}_g \le p_g \le \bar{p}_g                                                       &                                              & \forall g \in \mathcal{G} \label{eq:genbounds}                  \\
               & \theta_{b_0} = 0                                                                            &                                              & \text{(reference bus)} \label{eq:ref}
\end{align}
where $c_g$ is the marginal production cost, $F_\ell$ the capital charge for candidate $\ell$, $d_b$ the net load at bus $b$, $B_\ell$ the susceptance of line $\ell$, and $\bar f_\ell$ its thermal limit. Equations~\eqref{eq:balance} enforce nodal power balance, \eqref{eq:dcflow} impose DC power flow, and \eqref{eq:candlimit} couple flows on candidate lines to their binary build decisions through a Big-M formulation.

In the multi-period implementation (\texttt{src/core/multi\_period\_tep.py}) the variables $p_g$, $f_\ell$, and $\theta_b$ are indexed by representative time period while the investments $x_\ell$ remain static across all periods.

\subsection{Load Shedding Extension}
To study infeasible periods or deliberate stress tests we add non-negative slack variables $s_b$ representing curtailed demand with penalty $\gamma$:
\begin{align}
    \min \quad & \sum_{g} c_g p_g + \gamma \sum_{b} s_b                     \\
    \text{s.t.} \quad
               & \eqref{eq:balance} \text{ with } d_b \leftarrow d_b - s_b,\quad s_b \ge 0.
\end{align}
In the implementation, $\gamma$ is the \texttt{shedding\_cost\_per\_mw} argument supplied to \texttt{TEPWithLoadShedding}; we set $\gamma=\$50{,}000$/MWh in \texttt{run\_load\_shedding\_analysis.py} as a value-of-lost-load (VOLL) penalty when quantifying shortages in Section~\ref{sec:loadshed}.

\section{Baseline DC-OPF Benchmark}
The starting point is the static DC-OPF implemented in \texttt{src/core/dc\_opf.py}. The DC-OPF is a linear program that minimizes total generation cost subject to power balance, DC power flow equations, generator limits, and transmission thermal limits. Table~\ref{tab:baseline} compares the baseline dispatch with the single-period TEP result.

The grid satisfies the full 8,550~MW of system load at a \$138,967 operating cost. Three inter-regional transmission corridors operate at their thermal limits (100\% utilization):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Line A27}: 500 MW / 500 MW (intra-regional)
    \item \textbf{Line CA-1}: 500 MW / 500 MW (Region C to A)
    \item \textbf{Line CB-1}: 500 MW / 500 MW (Region C to B)
\end{itemize}

Despite this congestion, when the TEP MILP is allowed to build new lines, it chooses not to---the operating cost savings from congestion relief do not justify the capital expenditure. This anchors our storyline: if a model that \textit{can} build still chooses not to, subsequent sections must identify stronger drivers before expansion becomes rational.

\end{table}

\subsection{Generation Mix Analysis}
Figure~\ref{fig:generation-mix} shows the generation dispatch by fuel type under baseline conditions. The dispatch reveals a merit-order pattern: nuclear and hydro provide baseload (near-zero marginal cost), combined-cycle gas turbines (CC) provide intermediate load, and combustion turbines (CT) and steam units handle peak requirements. Renewable sources (wind, PV) operate at their available capacity.

    \caption{Generation mix by fuel type (left) and capacity utilization (right). Nuclear and hydro operate at high capacity factors, while peaking units remain largely idle.}
    \label{fig:generation-mix}
\end{figure}

\section{Transmission Cost Modeling and Sensitivity}
The next hypothesis is economic: perhaps the system would build if capital were cheaper. The TEP code supports three capital cost models, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:costmodels} for a representative 500~MW, 100-mile, 230~kV line.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
        Model                      & Formula                                              & Cost [\$] \\
        \midrule
        Capacity-distance          & \$1M/MW $\times$ 500 MW $\times$ (160.9 km / 100 km) & 804.7M    \\
        Distance-based (preferred) & \$1.5M/mile $\times$ 100 miles (230 kV)              & 150.0M    \\
        Capacity-only              & \$200k/MW $\times$ 500 MW                            & 100.0M    \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Capital cost comparison for a single candidate line using different cost models. The distance-based model reflects MISO/FERC industry data.}
    \label{tab:costmodels}
\end{table}

We conducted a comprehensive cost sensitivity analysis, sweeping the line cost parameter from \$100k/MW to \$1M/MW across 10 logarithmically-spaced points. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cost-sensitivity}, even at aggressively low capital costs (\$100k/MW, yielding a \$50M line), no expansion was triggered. The operating cost remains flat at \$138,967 across all tested cost levels, and zero lines are built. This confirms that the system has sufficient capacity margin: operating cost savings from congestion relief never offset even minimal capital charges.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../results/plots/plot_cost_sensitivity.png}
    \caption{Cost sensitivity analysis showing flat operating cost and zero buildout across all tested capital cost levels. The system's inherent redundancy means congestion relief provides negligible economic benefit.}
    \label{fig:cost-sensitivity}
\end{figure}

\section{Time-Series Integration and Multi-Period TEP}
Since cheaper capital still did not trigger expansion, we turned to time-varying stress: do representative hours with different renewable availability create a need for new lines? We incorporated hourly load and renewable profiles through a two-stage approach:

\subsection{Representative Period Selection}
The \texttt{TimeseriesLoader.select\_representative\_periods} method offers multiple selection strategies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Peak/average/low}: Selects periods from the top 25\% (peak), middle 50\% (average), and bottom 25\% (low) of system load.
    \item \textbf{$k$-means clustering}: Groups similar load profiles and selects one representative from each cluster.
\end{itemize}

For tractability we start with the simpler peak/average/low split and explicitly inspect periods 1--12.

\subsection{Feasibility Analysis}
Our analysis revealed that periods 1--6 are infeasible under strict minimum generation constraints ($P_{\min}$) because total minimum generation (3,775~MW from baseload units) exceeds the total load (3,400--3,700~MW) during these low-demand hours. The detailed analysis in \texttt{results/infeasibility\_analysis/} quantifies this gap:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Excess minimum generation: $\sim$371 MW
    \item Root cause: Nuclear and baseload units cannot reduce output below technical minimums
    \item Solution options: Relax minimum generation constraints or enable load shedding
\end{itemize}

Periods 7--12 are feasible with successful DC-OPF solutions. Peak periods (10--11) have the highest loads at approximately 4,050--4,085 MW.

\subsection{Simplified Multi-Period TEP Results}
We implemented a two-stage approach in \texttt{src/core/simplified\_multi\_period\_tep.py}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Stage 1}: Run DC-OPF across multiple periods to identify peak congestion (periods 10--11).
    \item \textbf{Stage 2}: Solve a stress-tested TEP with:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 150\% load multiplier on base peak load
        \item Additional 500~MW industrial load at bus 122
        \item Targeted line derates on congested corridors
        \item Reduced capital cost (\$200k/MW)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Result}: Even under this extreme scenario (total peak load: 6,661 MW), the solver prefers to redispatch generation rather than build new lines. Zero lines built, zero load shedding, \$129k total operating cost. The model size was modest (798 constraints, 440 variables, 8 binary) and solved in under 0.01 seconds.

\section{Supply Shortage Stress Test}\label{sec:loadshed}
The early representative-period runs expose feasibility tension in low-load hours due to minimum generation limits. Rather than ignore shortages, we price them explicitly using the load shedding formulation implemented in \texttt{TEPWithLoadShedding}.

\subsection{Methodology}
The stress test in \texttt{run\_load\_shedding\_analysis.py} applies extreme conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Derate all generators to 20\% of nameplate capacity
    \item Scale nodal loads by 140\% (40\% increase)
    \item Apply \$50,000/MWh penalty on unserved energy (VOLL)
    \item Disable candidate line construction
\end{itemize}

This combination creates an acute supply shortage that forces the model to use load shedding slack variables.

\subsection{Results}
Table~\ref{tab:loadshed} shows the period-by-period outcomes. The optimizer maximizes the remaining 2,910~MW of generation capacity and sheds the balance. Load shedding ranges from 37.3\% to 43.0\% across periods, with penalty costs between \$86.7M and \$109.9M per period.

\begin{table}[h]

    \begin{tabular}{cccccc}

        2      & 4,669     & 2,910           & 1,759          & 37.7\%         & 88.0          \\

        4      & 4,659     & 2,910           & 1,749          & 37.5\%         & 87.4          \\
        5      & 4,830     & 2,910           & 1,920          & 39.8\%         & 96.0          \\
        6      & 5,108     & 2,910           & 2,198          & 43.0\%         & 109.9         \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Load shedding outcomes under severe supply shortage stress test. All available generation (2,910 MW) is dispatched; the remainder is curtailed.}
    \label{tab:loadshed}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:load-shed-plot}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Interpretation}
The shortage penalty provides an explicit economic benchmark: at \$50k/MWh VOLL, a single hour of 2,000 MW curtailment costs \$100M. Any resilience investment (new generation, transmission, or storage) can be evaluated against this scarcity price. The results also demonstrate that our optimization framework correctly captures supply-demand imbalances as decision variables rather than model infeasibilities.

\section{Scenario-Based Robust Expansion}
All deterministic and time-series variants so far choose not to build new transmission. To test whether uncertainty itself forces expansion, we introduced a scenario-based robust TEP model (\texttt{src/core/scenario\_robust\_tep.py}) in which the binary build decisions must satisfy multiple stress cases simultaneously.

\subsection{Scenario Definition}
Table~\ref{tab:robust-scenarios} defines the three scenarios used in \texttt{run\_robust\_tep.py}. Each scenario applies its own load factor, renewable availability, and branch derating pattern while sharing the common investment vector $x_\ell$.

\begin{table}[h]

    \begin{tabular}{lllll}
        \toprule

    \caption{Scenario definitions for robust TEP. The ``high\_load\_low\_renew'' scenario combines load growth, renewable drought, and severe branch derates on the three congested corridors.}

\end{table}

\subsection{Robust TEP Results}
Solving the MILP with a reduced candidate cost of \$120k/MW yields the per-scenario operating profiles in Table~\ref{tab:robust-results}. \textbf{To remain feasible under the derated interties, the model proactively builds two 200~MW links}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bus 101 $\rightarrow$ Bus 106 (200 MW)
    \item Bus 101 $\rightarrow$ Bus 117 (200 MW)
\end{itemize}
Combined capital expenditure: \$61.3M.

\subsection{Analysis}
The robust formulation differs fundamentally from single-scenario TEP: instead of optimizing for one load/renewable condition, it requires feasibility across a range of futures. The \texttt{high\_load\_low\_renew} scenario with 40\% derates on the congested interties creates binding transmission constraints that cannot be resolved by redispatch alone. The investment in two new 200~MW lines provides the necessary transfer capability.

The weighted objective value is \$61.46M, dominated by capital expenditure. This highlights the core tradeoff in robust planning: upfront investment cost versus guaranteed feasibility under stress.

\subsection{Computational Notes}
All models were solved using Gurobi 13.0+ on the Gurobi Web License Service (WLS). Model sizes range from 798 constraints (simplified TEP) to several thousand (full multi-period and robust formulations). The academic WLS license imposes limits on model size (rows, columns, nonzeros); the simplified two-stage approach keeps models within these limits. Solution times were typically under 1 second for single-period models and under 10 seconds for robust formulations.

\section{Conclusions}
Across the deterministic and time-series experiments, the RTS-GMLC system behaves as a resilient grid: even with 150\% load multipliers, added industrial demand, and derated interfaces, the models prefer redispatch to new construction. This aligns with our project objectives by demonstrating that congestion alone does not justify expansion under current load and renewable profiles.

\subsection{Key Findings}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{System Robustness}: The RTS-GMLC network has significant inherent redundancy. It can handle extreme stress (150\% load, +500 MW new demand) through generation redispatch without requiring transmission expansion.
    
    \item \textbf{Congestion Management}: Three inter-regional ties (A27, CA-1, CB-1) operate at thermal limits under base conditions. However, the system accommodates this congestion by adjusting the generation dispatch, demonstrating that congestion does not automatically imply an expansion need.
    
    \item \textbf{Economic Threshold}: Our cost sensitivity analysis found no break-even point where expansion becomes attractive, even at capital costs as low as \$100k/MW. Operating cost savings from congestion relief are negligible.
    
    \item \textbf{Scarcity Pricing}: The load shedding analysis assigns concrete costs to unmet demand---\$88--110M per stressed period at \$50k/MWh VOLL. This provides a benchmark against which resilience investments can be evaluated.
    
    \item \textbf{Robustness Drives Investment}: The only formulation that triggers expansion is scenario-based robust TEP. When required to satisfy simultaneous load growth (+20\%), renewable drought (-30\%), and severe branch derates (-60\% on congested lines), the model builds two 200~MW ties at \$61.3M total cost.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Future Work}
Consistent with our original project goals, several extensions would strengthen this analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Full stochastic programming}: Replace the discrete scenario set with probabilistic load/renewable distributions and two-stage stochastic optimization.
    \item \textbf{N-1 security constraints}: Add contingency constraints requiring the system to survive single-element outages.
    \item \textbf{Extended time horizon}: Analyze a full year (8,760 hours) using clustering to select representative periods.
    \item \textbf{Multi-stage expansion}: Allow phased construction over multiple planning periods with different discount rates.
    \item \textbf{Storage integration}: Include battery storage as an alternative to transmission expansion for managing variability.
\end{itemize}
